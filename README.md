## Known issues - Vencord

1. Cause this theme is created with BetterDiscord it has some design issues in Vencord. Buttons are not having the right clip path or get to multiline. If you have some issues that makes Vencord unusable create an issue for me. Else I'll try my best to make it as good as possible for both clients.
2. Horizontal Server list currently not working: waiting for update
